  "lead_paragraph": "Good morning. Gabrielle Hamilton has a beautiful recipe in The Times this week, for cold candied oranges (above). It’s accompanied by an essay that’s a glittery, perfect jewel. I think it might get you to make the dish even on a weeknight, just so you can have it the next night after dinner, a perfect taste of adult paradox, “juicy but cooked,” Gabrielle writes, “candied but fresh, bitter but sweet — that’s all there is to say and certainly all that is needed.” Secure a channel knife on the way home, some good seedless oranges, a box of sugar. Then: go to!",
