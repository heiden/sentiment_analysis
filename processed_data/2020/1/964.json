  "lead_paragraph": "SCHITT’S CREEK 9 p.m. on Pop. It’s the beginning of the end for this light Canadian sitcom. The Rose family has (mostly) grown accustomed to Schitt’s Creek, a rural town they bought as a joke gift and then moved to after losing their fortune. In the Season 5 finale — beware, spoilers ahead — Patrick (Noah Reid) and David (Dan Levy) got engaged, Moira (Catherine O’Hara) celebrated the premiere of her “Cabaret” production, and Stevie (Emily Hampshire) had a what-am-I-doing-with-my-life moment. The sixth and final season opens with David on the hunt for a wedding venue and Johnny (Eugene Levy) and Moira enjoying a romantic picnic. The show received Emmy recognition for the first time last year, earning four nominations. In an interview with The New York Times, Eugene Levy, who created the series with his son, Dan, said he thought Season 6 would be the strongest yet and that “the series is ending in a way that wraps this up with a lovely bow.”",
