  "lead_paragraph": "In the late 1950s, the social psychologist Dr. Milton Rokeach took three paranoid schizophrenic men who all believed themselves to be Jesus Christ and brought them together, to see how they would react. His findings, about which even he eventually raised ethical qualms, weren’t limited to professional journals. The movie “Three Christs” is based on his book “The Three Christs of Ypsilanti,” published in 1964 and still in print. The story has been dramatized elsewhere, including onstage.",
