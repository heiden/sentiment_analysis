  "lead_paragraph": "When Deborah Brenner wanted to open a brick-and-mortar outlet for her pastry company, Las Delicias Patisserie, a Greenmarket regular for 10 years, she had to get permission from the people who run the Greenmarkets. (Most Greenmarket vendors are not shopkeepers.) Approval came through, and now she sells her regular and gluten-free pastries, like rugelach, babkas, muffins, scones, cookies, brownies and savory tarts, on the lower level of the Chelsea Market. An economist and former banker, she got into this business because her husband is severely gluten-intolerant. As gluten-free goes, her treats are commendable, but she advises warming up the babkas and breads to improve them before digging in. Among the items she’s selling at Chelsea Market are crème brûlée seared to order, and panna cottas, which she cannot offer in the Greenmarket because she has no refrigeration there.",
