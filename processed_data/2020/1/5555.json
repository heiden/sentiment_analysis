  "lead_paragraph": "On his way to Monday night’s quarterfinal match at this Australian Open, third-seeded Roger Federer, a 20-time Grand Slam tournament winner, did not play a seeded player. Although he struggled in his third-round match against John Millman, Federer looked fresh and decisive in his other three victories. Even when a portion of Federer’s game is not up to par, it can still rise above even other world-class players. Forehand errors defined the third-round match, but Federer won it off a forehand winner on a point in which Millman had pressed him into a poor position.",
