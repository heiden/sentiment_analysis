  "lead_paragraph": "GRACE AND FRANKIE Stream on Netflix. Lily Tomlin eats takeout noodles with a pair of tongs. Jane Fonda alternates between sips of a margarita and a shot of tequila. These are a couple of the charmingly indulgent things that happen in the new, penultimate season of this warm comedy series. “Grace and Frankie” stars Fonda and Tomlin as frenemies who become inseparable after their husbands (played by Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston) fall in love with each other. One of the main story lines in the new season involves Fonda and Tomlin’s characters inventing a device meant to help people lift themselves off toilet seats.",
