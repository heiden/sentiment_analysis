  "lead_paragraph": "At least 87 pro-government forces and 12 civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the past week, as violent incidents occurred with greater frequency after a brief lull in Taliban attacks due, in part, to cold weather. The deadliest attack took place in Baghlan Province, where an insider attack killed 18 police officers, including the unit commander. One day later, in Kunduz Province, another 13 security forces were killed when the Taliban attacked security outposts in the Dasht-e-Archi District center. Earlier in the week, six civilians in Balkh Province were killed when Afghan Air Forces bombed a house in Boqa village. Two American soldiers — Lt. Col. Paul K. Voss and Capt. Ryan S. Phaneuf — were also killed when the aircraft they were piloting crashed in the Deh Yak District of Ghazni Province. An investigation into the crash is underway, though harsh weather is suspected to have played a role.",
