  "lead_paragraph": "I was impressed by Danou, a family friend who lived next door to me in rural France, not just because she was significantly older (retired) and smoked Gauloises (one pack a day) and had two dogs (two!), but because her go-to dessert was chocolate mousse. She had a life outside the kitchen, but so much of the time I spent with her was on the weekends, hanging around her house as she got ready for Sunday lunch, helping her make that mousse. It was a process, the same each time, and my responsibilities were fairly small. I cracked and separated the eggs and checked the bowls for egg shell. I broke the chocolate along segment lines and checked the bowl for foil bits. I set a pot of water on to boil, to melt the chocolate. Then I climbed onto the counter to get the Bowl.",
