  "lead_paragraph": "AVENUE 5 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Armando Iannucci, the creator of “Veep,” returns to HBO with this new black comedy starring Hugh Laurie. Set 40 years in the future, the show takes place on Avenue 5, a luxury space cruise ship that has taken off for an eight-week journey around Saturn. The experience is exquisite, for a moment. Then the ship’s system malfunctions and sets it off course, leading to delirium onboard. As the fate of the ship remains up in the air, disgruntled passengers demand answers from the captain (Laurie) and his ill-equipped crew. Josh Gad plays the clueless billionaire who owns the ship; Suzy Nakamura is his stern right-hand woman; and Zach Woods is, like his character on “The Office,” essentially useless as the head of customer relations. The 10th season premiere of CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM follows at 10:30.",
