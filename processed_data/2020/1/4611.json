I feel good.” And he said, “I’m happy.” And I said, “I’m happy.” And he said, “I like this.” And I said, “I like you.” That was it — not in a “that was it, they fell in love” kind of way, but in a “that was it, he saw the possibility of connection beyond the confines of my bed and got scared and ran away” type of way. — Sarah Marlin",
