  "lead_paragraph": "I am going to describe a video that threw me into a pit of despair. It begins with a woman running into the aisle of a big-box store and telling a tween boy that she needs phone chargers. He asks why; she says all her chargers are missing. “You came to the right place,” he says, gesturing to the rack next to him. “This is Android, though,” the woman says. “I need iPhone.” The boy tells her she will find iPhone chargers if she takes five steps back. Here the performance shifts from mere stiltedness to a kind of hateful Kabuki, an affected defiance of how people naturally act: She walks backward, counting her steps, then turns and slaps her forehead. “Whoa,” she says. “That was so . . . amazing.” She drops a charger trying to take it off the rack. “Whoops,” she says, looking at the camera without affect. The boy says, “Androids are trash, but they make a living” — a phrase that comes to me now unbidden as I fall asleep, jolting me awake in a way I imagine is common to unpunished murderers. The woman says that iPhones make a living, too, and asks, “You ready to cash out?” Then it’s over.",
