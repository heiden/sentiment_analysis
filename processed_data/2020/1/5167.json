Our recommended books this week take on the big topics, from James Wood’s collection of literary criticism and personal essays to Ann Napolitano’s novel about a plane crash to Daniel Susskind’s look at the impact of artificial intelligence on the labor force. There’s also the history of a 19th-century power couple (written by NPR’s Steve Inskeep), a debut novel about women’s interior lives and a study of everyday citizens in authoritarian Russia.",
