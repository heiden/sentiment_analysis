  "lead_paragraph": "A few years before half of the family was murdered, the Kushners, as they usually did, took a summer vacation in the tiny town of Novoyl’na, then part of Poland. Amid the sharp scents of pine and spruce, and fresh water from the lake, the Kushner children played in the forest. On Friday evenings, as the late-setting sun angled through the woods, the family gathered for Shabbat dinner. Parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, cousins sat in front of tall white candles to eat chicken soup, sweet kugel, the ever-present braided challah bread. “Summer camp” was how the surviving Kushners would later describe these trips. “Camping” and “going to camp” were among their fondest memories.",
