  "lead_paragraph": "Among the most dense and affluent districts in Paris, the 16th arrondissement has long been considered a sleepy, stuffy, gastronomic desert on the French capital’s vast culinary landscape. François-Régis Gaudry, the 44-year-old food critic, radio and television host, and best-selling author of Let’s Eat France!, knows the area’s limitations firsthand: Every week for the last decade, he has recorded his wildly popular radio show, “On Va Déguster,” at La Maison de la Radio, the 16th arrondissement headquarters for Radio France broadcasting. But now there are compelling reasons to direct appetites here on the city’s western edge. ",
