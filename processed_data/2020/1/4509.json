  "lead_paragraph": "It’s a homecoming for Michael Toscano, the former executive chef of Perla. He moved to Charleston, S.C., in 2012, with his wife, Caitlin, and opened Le Farfalle. Now he’s back on Minetta Lane, in the former Perla space, where he will showcase his personal take on Italian fare. His wife is the manager. Mr. Toscano strides fearlessly into offal territory with grilled beef tongue, snout-to-tail soup, chicken liver pâté with beef cheeks, and veal head parmigiana, made by using the meat to make a terrine, which is then sliced, breaded and cooked parmigiana-style. “I had not seen anyone do this before,” he said. Several dishes are based on family recipes, like the fideos (angel hair) with skate and chiles. Appetizers include stewed chickpeas, and oysters roasted with crab fat. Baked skate wing, barbecued oxtail and a pork chop wrapped in pork belly are also on the menu. The 62-seat room with an open kitchen is at once rustic and elegant, with bare wood and brick walls against marble, blue velvet, moss-green leather and Art Deco lights. (Opens Friday)",
