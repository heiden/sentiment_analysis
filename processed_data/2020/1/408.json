About a year after wrapping up that show, Glazer is taking a solo turn with this stand-up special, which includes sharp observations on anti-Semitism, sexism and homophobia. She also discusses married life and, briefly, the Alfred Hitchcock classic “Rear Window” (“It was fine,” she decrees, before doing a bit on Grace Kelly’s voice).",
