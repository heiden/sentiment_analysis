The search for love is still ostensibly at its core but, by this point, the spectacle surrounding it is at least as much of a draw as anything else. In the 24th season’s premiere episode, Peter Weber, an airline pilot, begins his tenure as the show’s focal point by meeting the 30 women competing for his affection. By the end of the marathon night only 22 will remain. Weber previously appeared as a contestant on the last season of “The Bachelorette,” in which he was Hannah Brown’s third choice. According to a preview of the episode, Brown, whose romance with her first choice Jed Wyatt didn’t work out, will make an appearance.",
