He had just clicked on a tweet from former President Obama, announcing his list of favorite books from 2019. Listed at No. 6 (titles were in alphabetical order) was Odell’s first book, “How to Do Nothing,” which our reviewer described as “a complex, smart and ambitious book that first reads like a self-help manual, then blossoms into a wide-ranging political manifesto.” The gist: Stop toggling. Pay attention. Notice nature.",
