  "lead_paragraph": "Adapted from Allison Ramsey Architects’ cottage plans, this home was constructed in 2019 by its owner, who is also the listing agent. It is 10 minutes on foot from the University of Mississippi campus and Courthouse Square, the historic heart of Oxford and the location of what is said to be the oldest department store in the South (Neilson’s, founded in 1839). Stone Park, with its new activity center, and the Oxford Depot Trail, a biking and pedestrian thoroughfare that was once a stretch of the Mississippi Central Railroad, are two blocks away.",
