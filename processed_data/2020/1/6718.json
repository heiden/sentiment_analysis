  "lead_paragraph": "Millennials are often labeled the poorest, most financially burdened generation in modern times. Many of them graduated from college into one of the worst labor markets the United States has ever seen, with a staggering load of student debt to boot. Beginning a career underemployed can depress earnings over a lifetime and delay milestones like purchasing a home and having children. Not surprisingly, millennials have accumulated less wealth than Generation X did at a similar stage in life, primarily because fewer of them own homes.",
