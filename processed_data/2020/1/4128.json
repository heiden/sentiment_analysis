  "lead_paragraph": "HONEYLAND (2019) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Hatidze Muratova is one of the last of her kind. She and her ailing mother are the only inhabitants of a small village in the Republic of North Macedonia, where Muratova makes a quiet living keeping bees. She practices the sustainable beekeeping methods of generations before her, like singing to her bees and making sure to only take half their honey. Then a family moves in next door, bringing with them cattle, several children, bees of their own and a threat to Muratova’s way of life, and the filmmakers Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov capture a story at the intersection of modernity and tradition. “Their movie is quiet, intimate and intense, but touched with a breath of epic grandeur,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “It’s a poem including history.”",
