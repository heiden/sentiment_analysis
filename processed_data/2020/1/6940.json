  "lead_paragraph": "In a modest brick apartment house on Staten Island, the antiques collector George Way crammed British and Dutch furniture and art to the ceiling, scarcely leaving circulation routes between 17th-century armchairs and old master portraits of noblewomen. Part of his collection is now going on view in the hands of new institutional owners, with wall texts paying tribute to Mr. Way, who died in June, at 69.",
