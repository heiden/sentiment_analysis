  "lead_paragraph": "“Please don’t ghost your therapist,” says Catherine F. Eubanks, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at Yeshiva University in New York, whose research focuses on the bond between therapists and patients. If you feel unsafe, or your therapist has done something unethical or inappropriate, quit therapy in whatever way you want. If you and your therapist have mutual respect and trust, but you feel ready to be done, for whatever reason, tell the person. “This could be an amazing opportunity for you to work through an interpersonal strain or conflict as it’s happening,” Eubanks says. Studies show that patients who repaired a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship with their therapist had better psychotherapy outcomes than those who never experienced a breakdown at all.",
