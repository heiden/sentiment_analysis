  "lead_paragraph": "ACROSTIC — Did anyone else have a visceral response to the passage today and smell burned hair? I love it when words activate another sense. The author, Deborah Blum, is an expert in poisons, their history and their effects on the body; the passage is autobiographical and relates to her relevant interests earlier in life. Ms. Blum is a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on primate research, and has also written books about sex and affection. It makes sense that she's honed her skills at recording hard-to-express experiences, but I’m still impressed and amazed at how clearly she set the scene in this passage, in just a handful of words.",
