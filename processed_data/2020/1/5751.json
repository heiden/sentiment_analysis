I have nothing against Fred Piscop and his intricate, wonderful creations: I just find them hard to solve, and harder to explain how to solve. Turns out, that’s the real issue. Split Decisions puzzles are visually self-explanatory, and I don’t approach them with any special finesse or skill that I can impart to you, readers, so I’m really just the host here. Acknowledging that not only takes the pressure off, it made this solve, which has some really evocative words, much more fun.",
