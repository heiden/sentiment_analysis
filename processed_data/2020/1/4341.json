  "lead_paragraph": "Although Burna Boy’s “African Giant” is nominated for best world music album, he’s not staying in any niche. His understated, insinuating rhythms — mixing percussion and electronics — connect to Jamaica, Puerto Rico and American R&B and trap as well as to the Nigerian Afrobeat of Fela Kuti (Burna Boy is from Lagos, Nigeria). Since his debut album in 2013, Burna Boy has recorded alongside Drake, Ed Sheeran, Lily Allen, Stormzy and others. His lyrics, like Fela’s, juggle English and Nigerian languages and patois, as he offers African pride and straightforward history lessons along with tales of night life and romance. JON PARELES",
