  "lead_paragraph": "Q: A few months ago I made an offer to buy an Upper East Side co-op. The owner countered and we agreed on a price. I got my financial documents in order and my letters of recommendation to present to the board. I also hired a real estate attorney who began working on the transaction and recommended I hire an engineer to check out the apartment. About 10 days later, the owner took the property off the market. I had already paid the attorney half of her fee. Can I ask the seller to refund that money to me, since she did not follow through on her part of the deal?",
