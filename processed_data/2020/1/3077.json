There’s a novel about a missing sister and the opioid crisis in Philadelphia (“Long Bright River”); a journalistic account of Detroit’s bankruptcy and its repercussions (“Broke”); a recap of Brett Kavanaugh’s troubled and polarizing path to the Supreme Court (“Supreme Ambition”); and an intimate portrayal of the ravages facing the working poor (“Tightrope”).",
