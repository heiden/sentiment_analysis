You met there, the summers are lovely, and the country is not actively crowdsourcing “bong money” to make sure a big bell goes off at the precise moment it throws itself into international disarray. Plus, there is the matter of your family’s longstanding history as merciless imperialists and a swathe of British citizens and newspapers who, for reasons that couldn’t possibly be racism, have harangued, harassed and libeled you both into the ground. This, combined with how good I know you both look in winter hats, makes me think it will be a very fruitful move indeed.",
