Feras Fayaad, who was born in Syria, directed most of the film remotely, relying on cinematographers to record the lives of Dr. Amani Ballour and her patients in a secret, underground hospital outside Damascus. A hero in the film and in her community, Ballour is one of the rare women doctors in the country, and she is constantly challenged for it. This is the least of her worries in the hospital, known as the cave. Above ground — where war planes are zooming overhead — the demolition caused by bombings, malnutrition and chemical attacks brings Syrians of all ages to her care, where all she can do is her best.",
