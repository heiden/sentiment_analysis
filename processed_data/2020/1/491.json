  "lead_paragraph": "Good morning. I’m driving north today into the snow and salt, and if I’m lucky there’ll be sea smoke on the bay when I arrive, hoarfrost in the pine trees, a good fire going inside. I’ll cook then to answer the season: the writer Jim Harrison’s take on a Caribbean stew (above), made from the bounty I’ve got in the cooler in the bed of the truck. So, spareribs, chicken thighs, Italian sausages, onion, garlic, hot pepper sauce, chile powder, paprika, stock. Bubble that along, and then serve it on rice with super-cold beers on the side. The combination tastes of hot summer even in the north woods in the afternoon dark, a meal to eat barefoot in the humidity, as the ceiling fan whirs. Seasonal affective disorder is real, friends. Use your taste buds to fool your brain.",
