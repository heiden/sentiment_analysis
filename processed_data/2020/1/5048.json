  "lead_paragraph": "Hello and welcome to Five Weeknight Dishes. We all know September is back-to-school time, but this late-January repeat after the last gasp of winter holidays needs a name. Again, we are settling into weekly routines — except with more darkness and lesser holidays to look forward to (Presidents’ Day feast, anyone?).
