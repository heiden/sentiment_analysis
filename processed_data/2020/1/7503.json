  "lead_paragraph": "Isaac Bruce was a central cog in the St. Louis Rams’ “Greatest Show on Turf” offense. For 16 seasons, Bruce was a consistent vertical threat at wide receiver, and he ranks in the N.F.L.’s top 15 for career receptions (13th), receiving yards (fifth) and touchdown catches (12th). He was the leading receiver in a Super Bowl victory, and his No. 80 jersey was retired by the Rams.",
