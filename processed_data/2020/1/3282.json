  "lead_paragraph": "There were several times during our discussions that Radovan Karadzic wanted to demonstrate his skill at bioenergetic healing. The first was on Jan. 23, 2015, during the third of 12 four-hour-long conversations we had between October 2014 and November 2016. We were sitting in our little chairs at our little wooden table in the small room allocated to us by the United Nations prison in The Hague. Mr. Karadzic had gone into hiding following his 1995 indictment for genocide and crimes against humanity, including for his role in the murder of 8,000 men and boys in Srebrenica during the Bosnian war. I wanted to understand why he had disguised himself as an energy healer when he was on the lam.",
