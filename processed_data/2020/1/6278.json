  "lead_paragraph": "Last winter, I found myself in a familiar position: my neck craned forward, my hearing aids hissing along to a jukebox in a Manhattan dive bar, squinting and nodding as I tried to make out what was being said by my date, a handsome, affable man who had not taken to heart my suggestion that we go somewhere quiet and well lit. Granted, I had not informed him that I have severe-to-profound high-frequency hearing loss, but it has always been easier to adapt to the impositions of the full-hearing world than it is to volunteer information about my otherwise invisible disability, which confers few advantages except, by necessity, a skill for reading lips.",
