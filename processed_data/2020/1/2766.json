The 52-year old comedian just announced that she will be hosting a reboot of the game show “Supermarket Sweep” on ABC. And she has this new stand-up special, directed by the “Game of Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. In this performance, Jones lists the ups and downs of aging and argues that today’s 20-year-olds don’t know how to have fun. To prove her point, she roasts a young audience member for her subdued outfit choice, calling it a “Little House on the Prairie” sweater.",
