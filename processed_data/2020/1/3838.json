  "lead_paragraph": "An Italian portrait gallery — a pinacoteca, filled with antique paintings from the family collection — would be a fitting backdrop for an Etro show any season. After all, the brand is the consummate family business, founded in 1968 by Gimmo Etro and now helmed by his four children: Kean, who designs men’s wear; Jacopo, who designs home goods and accessories; Ippolito, who handles brand strategy; and Veronica, who designs women’s wear. (Even Kean’s 8-year-old daughter, Sofia, sometimes consults on runway soundtracks.) The house is also known for trademarks that include a lust for travel and an eye for jewel tones and florid patterns — especially paisley. But for Etro’s fall 2020 men’s wear show in Milan last weekend, Kean paid particular attention to ancestry, weaving together influences from his Italian heritage and from Argentina, where his wife, Constanza Cavalli Etro, grew up. This synthesis showed up throughout the collection: One model strode down the runway in a jacket that was half leather motorcycle and half wool blanket worn over an ocher turtleneck, while the closing look featured a fringed cape adorned with delicate silver embroidery. And, looming over the runway, was a pinacoteca: a collage of 19th-century portraits, some of them depicting the Etros of centuries past.",
