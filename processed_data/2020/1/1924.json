  "lead_paragraph": "The hit television show “The Good Place,” now in its fourth and final season, has done plenty to popularize philosophy, particularly moral philosophy, which is at the center of the show’s story line, as well as its humor. To ensure the philosophical accuracy in the show’s scripts, the producers consult philosophical advisers. We asked one of the advisers, the philosopher Todd May, the author of “A Decent Life: Morality for the Rest of Us” and a frequent Stone contributor, to comment on and develop the philosophy being explored in the Jan. 9 episode. You can watch the full episodes of the show at NBC.com.",
