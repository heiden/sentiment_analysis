  "lead_paragraph": "“You need upper-body strength,” says Jessica Welker, a sergeant with the San Jose Police Department who has worked as a physical-fitness trainer at the police academy for most of her 19-year career. Many police departments require recruits to pass a physical-agility test that often includes scaling a six-foot chain-link fence and a six-foot solid wall, tasks that tend to be particularly difficult for women. A survey from the National Center for Women & Policing found that law-enforcement agencies without an agility test have 45 percent more sworn women officers. “If you’re a woman,” Welker says, “you probably won’t get over a chain-link fence on your first try.”",
