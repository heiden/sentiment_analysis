  "lead_paragraph": "Susan Barba’s second book, “geode,” is rich with shining interiors and tactile relationships, delicate human to delicate earth, small delusions of ownership against wider backdrops of loss and time. Poems acting as guides, helping us navigate and remember, create an intricate overlay of worlds, humans and trees. This poem — bearing words like “testify” and “judge” — echoes our current moment and offers relief. The title itself is a strong suggestion: We have to keep working at not letting the anger overtake us, hold on too long. Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye",
