  "lead_paragraph": "Senate Republicans are threatening to give President Trump what even a foreign government knew was inappropriate: the dirtying of a political rival. What an irony it would be if Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial itself yielded the very result for which he is being impeached: the corruption of America’s election integrity by the baseless denigration of Mr. Trump’s leading rival. It’s a step Senate Republicans are wrong to push — and one Senate Democrats should consider very carefully before permitting as part of any deal for witnesses.",
