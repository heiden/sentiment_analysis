  "lead_paragraph": "JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 3 — PARABELLUM (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. At just over two hours, this over-the-top action flick is propelled forward mostly by a series of impeccably choreographed fight scenes. It is the third installment in the “John Wick” franchise by the returning director Chad Stahelski, and it picks up where the second film left off. John (Keanu Reeves) has been excommunicated from the High Table, the global society of villains to which he once belonged, and has a multimillion-dollar bounty on his head. Suddenly there’s a killer on every corner. Knowing he’s outnumbered, John heads to Morocco in hopes of revoking his death sentence. Along the way he seeks help from his former mentor (Anjelica Huston) and a friend from his past (Halle Berry), who has a couple of merciless dogs trained for combat. Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said that the movie’s endless cycle of violence can become deadening, but its elaborate thrills give it its edge. ",
