  "lead_paragraph": "SHRILL Stream on Hulu. Season 1 of this comedy series ended with its main character, Annie (Aidy Bryant), hurling a flower pot through a window of an internet troll’s Cadillac S.U.V. She also quit her job. And she couldn’t be happier. “I’m maybe the best I’ve ever been in my life,” she declares at the beginning of the new, second season. Adapted from Lindy West’s memoir of the same name, the series has been praised for its social commentary, and for Bryant’s performance. “She radiates the wounded hopefulness of someone who’s ready for the next chapter of her life,” Margaret Lyons wrote in her review of Season 1 for The New York Times, “and by the end of the six-episode season, she’s there.” What that next chapter contains is something the second season will have to answer.",
