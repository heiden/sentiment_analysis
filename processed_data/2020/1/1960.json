Maybe there will be a 100th monkey effect at some point. In hopes of that, I’m going to keep going over these puzzles clue by clue so that anyone who’s interested and humble enough to just give themselves over to this process will be able to finish each puzzle. If that’s you, I’m glad you’re here. By the end of the year, you’ll know what you’re doing at least as well as I do, and your brain will be all the more flexible and powerful for it.",
