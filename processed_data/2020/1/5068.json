  "lead_paragraph": "If you want to make sense of the Caribbean, you had better prepare for some island-hopping: This is a place where not just people but ideas and images are constantly on the move. That’s the premise and the appeal of “Arte del Mar: Art of the Caribbean,” a concentrated showcase at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that plunges visitors into a sea of archipelagic thinking. It is the Met’s first show to reckon with the Caribbean as its own zone of contact, and includes not only art from the West Indies — specifically on the island of Hispaniola, now divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; Puerto Rico; Cuba and the Turks and Caicos — but also from the Caribbean-facing coasts of mainland Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia.",
