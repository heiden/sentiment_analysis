  "lead_paragraph": "In Paris’s modish Marais, on a narrow street off the Rue Vieille du Temple, sits a grand 17th-century building that last housed a quincaillerie, or hardware store. It is here that the Tokyo-based architect, designer, restaurateur and chef Shinichiro Ogata has set his latest project — Ogata Paris, a newly opened multistory complex comprising a tea shop and tea salon, a full-service restaurant, a pastry shop, a bar, an art gallery, and a crafts and houseware store. It is a tour de force of one man’s vision of the best Japan has to offer; nearly every detail, from the cocktails to the glasses in which they’re served, has been designed by Ogata himself. It’s also his first solo foray into France, though his considered approach — to seek beauty and balance in all things — is the same one that’s governed all of his pursuits, including a bistro set in a plum tree-filled garden in Tokyo’s residential Meguro Ward and a collection of tree-free bamboo and bagasse paper plates made to look as thin and refined as china.
