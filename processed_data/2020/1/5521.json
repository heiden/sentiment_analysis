Bryan Stevenson’s powerful memoir of fighting for the rights of wrongly convicted death row inmates has also made appearances on the hardcover nonfiction list and the young adult list, among others — despite the fact that he wasn’t sold on the idea of writing a book in the first place. (“I wasn’t persuaded a book was a good investment of my time.”)",
