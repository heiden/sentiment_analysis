  "lead_paragraph": "The Paris-based architect and designer Rodolphe Parente refuses to subscribe to a signature style. “On each project, we create a different story; we try to have the right tone, to develop the right emotion,” the 39-year-old says of his narrative-driven approach, which is based on interpreting a client’s desires instead of imposing his own mark. For one recent apartment redesign in Monte Carlo, the unique Mediterranean light and the Modernist building itself inspired Parente to work with textured materials that would be enhanced by the changing shadows; by contrast, in 2015 he transformed a Parisian apartment built in 1910 into a spare futuristic pod with concrete walls and glossy red floors, channeling the client’s devotion to Buddhism, modern architecture and David Lynch.",
