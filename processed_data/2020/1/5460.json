I’m sure that many of you figured it out on your own, and kudos to you for that. This is an Erik Agard puzzle, so nothing’s out of bounds, and after last week’s bioengineering my poor brain saw “Engineering” again and just went haywire, I guess. I’m not going to lie, I was worried that we were going to have to combine all of the letters of all of the theme entries and anagram that whole mess into a bunch of different comestibles, which would have been bananas.",
