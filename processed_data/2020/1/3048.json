  "lead_paragraph": "EXPEDITION WITH STEVE BACKSHALL 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). “I think it’s really important that we’re rational today,” Steve Backshall says in the first episode of this adventure series. Moments later, Backshall and his team begin a rock climbing descent down a large canyon, one he describes as “four times the height of London’s Big Ben.” Few viewers, thankfully, are likely to tune to this British show to see perfectly rational behavior: “Expedition” follows Backshall, an adventurer known for hosting the BBC Show “Deadly 60,” as he ventures across various rugged frontiers, from flooded caves in Mexico to white water rapids in Bhutan. This first episode finds him in Oman. And that descent he compares to Big Ben? It’s just the prelude to an even more intense climb.",
