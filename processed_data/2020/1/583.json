  "lead_paragraph": "77TH ANNUAL GOLDEN GLOBES 8 p.m. on NBC. Netflix will likely be the big winner at the 2020 Golden Globe Awards. The streaming giant has 34 nods in total: “Marriage Story,” starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, received six alone, the most of any movie. Among the other contenders are “1917,” “The Irishman” and “The Joker,” for best drama, and “Dolemite Is My Name,” “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” and “Rocketman” for best musical or comedy. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group that produces the Globes, faced a backlash for excluding women in several major categories, including best director and motion picture. The best drama series category includes nominations for “The Morning Show,” “Big Little Lies” and “Killing Eve,” while “Fleabag,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “Barry” will compete for best comedy series. Ricky Gervais returns to host for the fifth time, which he says will be his last. Expect plenty of jabs. ",
