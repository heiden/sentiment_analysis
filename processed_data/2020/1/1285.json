  "lead_paragraph": "This lobby lounge, in the Company Building, which is home to a collection of tech start-ups, sprawls over 8,500 square feet, with cushy booths and tables, a 63-foot bar, and an arched, tiled ceiling to echo the Guastavino installation across the street in Grand Central Terminal. It’s the work of Company You Keep Hospitality, a division of Company, the firm that owns the building. The restaurant’s food consists mostly of bar fare, like charcuterie plates, pizza bianca with various toppings, and dips like a take on cacio e pepe with flatbread. Tien Ho, who was formerly with Momofuku, Whole Foods and, briefly, Wild Ink in Hudson Yards, is the chef. Graceanne Jordan, who worked with Danny Meyer, among others, is managing the restaurant, and Anthony Merlino, formerly at the Modern, is in charge of the bar. ",
