  "lead_paragraph": "Built on spec on vacant land in Hudson’s first gated community (dating to the turn of the 20th century), this home is one of several stately houses in the area. It is the last building on its side of a blocklong street, less than five minutes on foot from Warren Street, the city’s boutique- and restaurant-rich commercial stretch. An Amtrak train station is less than half a mile northwest, near the Henry Hudson Riverfront Park. Pennsylvania Station in New York City is two and a quarter hours south.",
