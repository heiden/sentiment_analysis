  "abstract": "This tome, from Meredith Erickson, an author of the Joe Beef cookbook, highlights the best of the Alps.",
  "lead_paragraph": "Yes, that’s the Matterhorn on the cover of this handsome, substantial cookbook and guide to the Alpine region of Europe. The book tours the mostly snow-covered terrain of Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland, with plates of mostly rustic comfort food at every welcoming inn and warming hut. Who knew there could be so many bread soups? It’s a book to enjoy when it blusters outdoors, even without a plane ticket to Europe or a pair of skis. A simple but classic dish of goulash from the Alto Adige in Italy, not Hungary, illustrates the reach of the Austro-Hungarian empire. A venison ragout can enrich a winter menu, as can Tyrolean hash with an egg, rösti potatoes, Savoie-style mushrooms and a Mont Blanc chestnut tart. But herbal Swiss Ricola (as in cough drops) ice cream? Think twice. The author, a Canadian and a skier, offers advice on visiting the area.",
