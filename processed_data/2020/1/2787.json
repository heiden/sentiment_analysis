  "lead_paragraph": "Leah Cohen’s latest has a broader scope than her Lower East Side spot, Pig and Khao. “The food at Pig and Khao is from Southeast Asia,” she said. Piggyback NYC’s focus is “all over Asia except India, and is inspired by our travels.” This new spot in Chelsea features Chinese dishes like a Hainanese duck with a rice cake and two sauces, as well as Filipino lumpia done Shanghai-style, and Korean wings with gochujang sauce. Still, Ms. Cohen’s menu makes several stops in Southeast Asia: Vietnam for her take on the fish and herb dish cha ca la vong, Thailand for fried rice and Indonesia for lamb rendang. The restaurant has a narrow, brick-walled space with a bar and some tables, and a kitchen pass-through that opens into a bright, airy and informal dining room whose walls Ms. Cohen’s husband and partner, Ben Byruch, papered with Asian newspapers and advertisements. Butterfly pea flower, Thai basil and gochujang season some cocktails. ",
