  "lead_paragraph": "Though Dvorak’s stirring, tuneful “New World” Symphony is justly popular, it tops my list of works that are heard too often for their own good. Perhaps my attitude comes in part from overkill during college: The instructor of a gym class I took played excerpts during exercise sessions. Even today, when I’m at a performance and the stern, pulsing third movement begins, I feel like I should be in the aisle doing jumping jacks.",
