  "lead_paragraph": "Michael Bloomberg’s presidential campaign has aroused the passions of Democratic voters. Unfortunately for Bloomberg — a formerly Republican, Wall Street-friendly billionaire who, as New York City mayor, supported the racially discriminatory “stop and frisk” policing strategy — those passions are largely negative ones. These personal and ideological priors aside, many Democrats are angry that Bloomberg, who has indicated he is willing to spend as much as $1 billion of his estimated $50 billion fortune on his campaign, seems to be trying to purchase their party’s nomination. The fear is that Bloomberg’s campaign will prolong the Democratic contest and, in the end, produce a hobbled nominee — a nominee who almost certainly won’t be Bloomberg.",
