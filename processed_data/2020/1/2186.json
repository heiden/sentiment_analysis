There will be no marquee showdown with Lamar Jackson after the Baltimore Ravens were upset on Saturday. Instead, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes faced off against Deshaun Watson of the Houston Texans in an offense-heavy game on Sunday that will be remembered as much for its dramatic swings as Mahomes’s majesty.",
