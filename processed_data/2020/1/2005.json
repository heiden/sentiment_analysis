  "lead_paragraph": "Good morning. Dorie Greenspan took on the Swedish concept of “fika” this week in The Times: a coffee break, essentially, with a little bite to eat, a moment to slow down and connect with others, to reflect. Of course she has a recipe to go with her story, for Swedish almond cake (above), and I’m hoping you will make it today and bring its cozy deliciousness into your life and the lives of others, with big mugs of milky coffee and lots of conversation.",
