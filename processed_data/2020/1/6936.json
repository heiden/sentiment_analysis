  "lead_paragraph": "“He’s a strange little man.” That’s how the New York actor Gideon Glick describes Seymour Krelborn, the menschy, dorky, ultimately murderous antihero of the cult classic musical “Little Shop of Horrors,” whom Glick, 31, is currently playing through March in an Off Broadway revival that runs at the Westside Theater. The production opened in October with the actor Jonathan Groff in the role, but Glick, who was at the time starring as Dill Harris in Aaron Sorkin’s Broadway adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” filled in for two weeks in November when Groff had a conflict. At the end of that temporary stint — during which Glick’s deep skills as one of New York’s best contemporary character actors (namely, his ability to channel his own inherent strangeness, his high voice often cracking, his knees seemingly quaking) were on full, glorious display — the director, Michael Mayer, asked if he wanted to take over the role after Groff finished his contract.",
