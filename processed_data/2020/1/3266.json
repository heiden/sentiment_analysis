This straightforward dramedy, which is Amazon’s first foray into the streaming-only movie space, follows Christmas Flint (Mckenna Grace), an eccentric girl growing up in rural Georgia. It’s 1977, Jimmy Carter is president and Christmas is determined to make contact with aliens by recording a message on NASA’s Golden Record, a time-capsule of sounds and images launched into space and intended for extraterrestrial life.",
