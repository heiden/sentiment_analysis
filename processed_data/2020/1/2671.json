  "lead_paragraph": "The song I listened to most this past year was ‘‘The Happy Song,’’ by the English singer-songwriter Imogen Heap. I didn’t play any other songs by Imogen Heap last year, or any other year. I don’t think I’ve ever even heard any other songs by her. But this song, ‘‘The Happy Song,’’ I played every single day, often eight or 10 times in succession. As music, I could take it or leave it. It’s not great. But from a strictly utilitarian point of view? From the point of view of sheer effectiveness? Surely the greatest song ever recorded.",
