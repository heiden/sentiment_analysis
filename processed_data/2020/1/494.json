  "lead_paragraph": "This is a story about the screenwriting Oscars and who’ll probably lose them. But in order to tell it, let’s go back to the 1983 Oscars, when the five original screenplay nominees were “Diner,” “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” “Gandhi,” “An Officer and a Gentleman” and “Tootsie.” Even with no “Personal Best,” “Smash Palace” or “Shoot the Moon”: a good year! Although, I’d have no problem boiling the five down to “E.T.” and “Tootsie,” and I’m not going to choose between them, because I don’t have to. (O.K. Fine. “Tootsie.”) And yet, John Briley won for “Gandhi.” But how did anybody know that was the best screenplay? Who read it?",
