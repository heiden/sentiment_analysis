  "lead_paragraph": "Q: For five years, I have lived in a market-rate apartment. Last year, my landlord tried to raise my rent by 10 percent, but I talked him down to 6 percent. This year, I suspect he’ll want a big hike and will not be open to negotiation. However, according to the new rent law, I’m supposed to get a 90-day notice for any rent increase above 5 percent. My lease is up in two months, and I haven’t gotten a renewal. If the landlord does try to raise the rent significantly at this point, what are my options?",
