  "lead_paragraph": "PARTY OF FIVE 9 p.m. on Freeform. Almost 20 years after its original run ended, the sitcom “Party of Five” is returning to television — with a jolt of modern political weight. The series, which debuted in 1994 and ran for six seasons, centered on a group of siblings who supported themselves after their parents died in a car crash. (It didn’t always go smoothly.) The new version, helmed by the series’s original creators, departs from the original story line in a major way: This time, the family members are on their own because their parents are deported to Mexico, not killed. And one sibling is a Dreamer. “This is an opportunity to really get into the perspective of a group of people in this country that has been marginalized — and on many occasions villainized — and just show they are people, too,” Michal Zebede, a co-executive producer and writer on the series, said in a recent interview with The New York Times.",
