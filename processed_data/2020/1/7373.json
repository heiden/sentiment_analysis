  "lead_paragraph": "AUSTIN CITY LIMITS: BILLIE EILISH 11 p.m. on PBS. The 18-year-old pop singer Billie Eilish, who took home five trophies from last week’s Grammy Awards, including for best new artist, is featured in this hourlong concert. Her set list is largely made up of songs from her debut album, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” (which won album of the year), including the dark, assertive pop hits “Bad Guy” and “You Should See Me In a Crown.” Popular singles like “Ocean Eyes” are featured as well. Though she is a young artist, Eilish has been redefining the pop music genre for years, Jon Pareles wrote for The New York Times, saying that “she’s sullen, depressive, death-haunted, sly, analytical and confrontational, all without raising her voice.”",
