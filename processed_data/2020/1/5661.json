  "lead_paragraph": "THE L WORD: GENERATION Q 10 p.m. on Showtime. This reboot of the “The L Word,” the pioneering series about lesbian life in Los Angeles, wraps up its first season. The mayoral candidate Bette (Jennifer Beals) is on the edge of her seat, waiting for the results on election night. While Shane (Katherine Moennig) and Quiara (Lex Scott Davis) face another bump in the road, Alice (Leisha Hailey) takes a risk with her show after a devastating drop in ratings. In her review for The New York Times, Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote that while “The L Word” “now better reflects Los Angeles’s ethnic and gender diversity,” it still needs some fine tuning. The original series “always stood on shaky, uncritical ground when it came to money and class, and ‘Generation Q’ offers little progress in that regard.” Fans who welcomed this sequel can breathe a sigh of relief: Showtime recently renewed it for a second season.",
