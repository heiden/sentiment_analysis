  "lead_paragraph": "Chris Jones was not on Kansas City’s final injury report heading into the game, and is expected to be active. The defensive tackle missed last week’s win over Houston with a calf injury, but had a breakout season in 2019, earning his first Pro Bowl selection. Jones led the team with nine sacks, and could be key in helping slow down Tennessee’s Derrick Henry, but he had to pass a pregame workout to be declared active. The Chiefs are also expecting tight end Travis Kelce to play through a lingering knee injury. Running back LeSean McCoy is inactive for the Chiefs, and Kansas City’s biggest absence is one they knew of in advance: rookie safety Juan Thornhill, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in Week 17.",
