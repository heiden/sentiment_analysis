But that wasn’t possible; the card had never left my wallet. The store manager discovered that one of my friends (who purchased the card) went back to the store with her receipt, had the card reissued and used it to buy a dress. The manager gave me all the documents. I couldn’t believe it! When I told my other two friends, they were furious. They had all contributed equally to the card. They say I have to confront her. I don’t know what to do. Advice?",
