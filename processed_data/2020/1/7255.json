These 10 tales from the Irish virtuoso of the short story, who died in 2016, center on ordinary people whose lives veer in surprising directions. “In this small, final, seemingly quiet but ultimately volcanic book of stories, Trevor denies and defies — maybe spites — the promise of decline,” Cynthia Ozick wrote here.",
