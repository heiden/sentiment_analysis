  "lead_paragraph": "Q: In the 1980s, when our children were very young, my husband and I left Park Slope, Brooklyn, for Levittown to raise our family, even though neither of us were from Long Island. Our children are now grown and have moved back to the city, where we visit them frequently. We’re interested in moving back to Brooklyn, but we’re torn. We’re in our early 60s, so how would we adjust to being renters again? Or to owning an apartment rather than a house? I’d miss having a backyard and my husband likes coming home to the suburbs. When do we know it’s time to move?",
