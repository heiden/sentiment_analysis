I was on the road the last few days and there wasn’t as much cooking as I’d have liked but the eating was grand: Josh Berry’s butter-aged steak at Union in Portland, Maine; the almond croissants Michelle Berry makes at Moonbat in Belfast; pretty much the whole menu at Jon Merry’s River House in Damariscotta. I topped it all off with a gallon of gas-station coffee and powered my way back home through snow flurries and potholes: 20 hours of driving in a little more than 36, a tombstone every mile.",
