  "lead_paragraph": "LINDA RONSTADT: THE SOUND OF MY VOICE (2019) 9 p.m. on CNN. “If I were going to choose something to do, it would not be to stand up in front of a lot of people,” the singer Linda Ronstadt says in this documentary. “But I love to sing, I love to sing, I love music. So at some point, you do whatever you have to do to do music.” That’s not exactly a stereotypical rock-star outlook, but Ronstadt didn’t have the typical rock star’s career: After reaching arena-level success in rock in the 1970s, she moved across genres, releasing albums of pop standards and Mariachi songs. (“People would think that I was trying to reinvent myself,” she says in the documentary, “but I never invented myself to start with.”) Her varied career is the focus here; it’s discussed by both Ronstadt and by interviewees like Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Cameron Crowe, Jackson Browne and Dolly Parton. “The political intelligence and matter-of-fact feminism that emerge in this portrait are among its most intriguing aspects,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. He wrote that Ronstadt’s “cleareyed, down-to-earth thoughts on her profession, her family and American culture (musical and otherwise) make her someone you want to know better.”",
