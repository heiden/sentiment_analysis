  "lead_paragraph": "In the majestic 17th-century Palazzo Corsini, on the banks of the Arno River in Florence, Telfar Clemens was staging a takeover. The Liberian-American designer, together with a band of creative collaborators he had flown to Italy from New York, was preparing to host an all-night dinner party and a runway show inside the palace, at the invitation of the men’s wear trade show Pitti Uomo. In baroque rooms decorated with antique tapestries of the Corsini crest and an imposing stone statue of the family’s papal forefather, the team styled looks for the show, made final preparations for the banquet and sang over the microphones that would later be used for impromptu musical performances — occupying the palace with what one fellow traveler lovingly referred to as “weird, freaky New York City essence.”",
