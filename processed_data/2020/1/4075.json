  "lead_paragraph": "The Tennessee Titans were lovable underdogs, but their luck ran out on Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs, who beat them, 35-24. The Green Bay Packers found some balance on offense in their first season under Coach Matt LaFleur, but they were crushed by the San Francisco 49ers, 37-20, in a game that was nowhere near that close. The Chiefs and the 49ers will now face off in Super Bowl LIV on Feb. 2 in Miami Gardens, Fla., in a matchup between one team with an electric passing game and one that relies on its defense and running the ball.",
