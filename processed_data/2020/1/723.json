  "lead_paragraph": "It is hard to think of another artist who was more beloved than John Baldessari, who died Thursday at 88. Although he was not a household name, he was hugely influential as a professor, and helped establish Los Angeles as the country’s reigning art-school capital. A tall, soft-spoken man with shaggy white hair and a biblical beard, Baldessari was easy to recognize. His champions like to say that he was “much more” than a teacher, but the statement offends, with its implicit suggestion that teaching is a mundane pursuit compared with the majesty of making art.",
