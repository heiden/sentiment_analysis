  "abstract": "The Harlem bakery has several kinds of alfajores, along with tarts and sandwiches.",
  "lead_paragraph": "In a now commonplace career switch, Daniel Minzer abandoned banking for baking. “I wanted a career change, and I have a passion for food,” said Mr. Minzer, a native of Chile. His Dulceria New York City, a new brick-walled bakery as narrow as a breadstick, features Chilean confections, notably alfajores (sandwich cookies). “Chile has great ingredients, but not much in the way of cuisine,” he said. “But pastries are the highlight.” He has hired Daniela Cañete to turn out several kinds of alfajores filled with dulce de leche, with one covered in chocolate, as well as elaborate cakes and layered confections, some embellished with meringue. Savory sandwiches on crusty rolls are also available.",
