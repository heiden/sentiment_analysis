What I love about covering this beat is that how we raise children touches on every topic imaginable: Money, privilege, politics, race, business and technology are all represented in my best-of list, in no particular order. Parenting also involves a range of emotions — the experience can bring you to places you didn’t know existed in yourself. I included that here as well, from the tragic to the ridiculous to the sublime. ",
