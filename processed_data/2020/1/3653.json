The nominations for the 92nd annual Academy Awards were announced on Monday, recognizing many of the best films and performances of the year, some of which are already available to stream. Among them is Pedro Almodóvar’s “Pain and Glory,” which was nominated for best international feature film. Antonio Banderas was also nominated for best actor in a leading role, his first Oscar nomination in his nearly 40-year career. Banderas also won the best actor prize at last year’s Cannes Film Festival for this role, as a depressed Spanish filmmaker who bears a curious resemblance to Almodóvar in career and appearance. “These teasing biographical gestures blur the line between reality and representation, but to see this movie as confessional would miss the point,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review, in which she designated the film a Critic’s Pick. “The point is the blur, that in-between space where art blooms.”",
