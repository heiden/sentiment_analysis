Instead of sending a single endangered innocent on a desperate race to escape some nefarious villain, he lets a group of villains loose on a defenseless town and sends a lone avenger to chase them down. Ever the master of detail, Perry first takes us to the Weldonville Federal Penitentiary in rural Colorado to marvel at the ingenuity of a dozen prisoners who escape by killing a dozen guards. But that’s not the worst of it. After dressing in the guards’ street clothes, the escapees allow more than 1,000 other prisoners to descend on the town “like an invading army” to kill and rape and burn the place to the ground. In effect, “they murdered Weldonville.” Two years later, Lt. Leah Hawkins is put on leave from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and unofficially licensed to hunt and kill the 12 ringleaders, now scattered across the country.",
