Take Kiley Reid, whose debut novel, “Such a Fun Age,” lands at No. 3 on this week’s hardcover fiction list. Reid had already sold the book when she graduated from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop last spring. Lena Waithe bought the screen rights; Reese Witherspoon selected it as a pick for her book club; and now Reid is in the midst of a multicity author tour. If you are like me, you might read this and feel a twinge of ennui.",
