  "lead_paragraph": "It is hard to find an anchor in “Cartography.” Kaneza Schaal and Christopher Myers’s documentary show, at the New Victory Theater, does not have a linear structure, presenting its stories for young audiences in interweaving fragments and hopscotching around countries and timelines. The set itself is made up of cardboard boxes that keep being rearranged — they form a back wall onto which images are projected, and it later tumbles down.",
