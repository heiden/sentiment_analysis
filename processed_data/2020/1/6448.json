  "lead_paragraph": "Francis Ford Coppola knows a thing or two about the Oscars, and about wine, with extensive and historic vineyards in Napa and Sonoma counties. This year, some of his wines, notably two swathed in gold, will be poured at the bar and backstage at the Academy Awards ceremony and the Governor’s Ball. And you can serve them too. They’re limited-edition Sonoma County Russian River Valley wines: a fruity yet balanced chardonnay that’s unmistakably Californian in a somewhat restrained manner, and an earthy, spicy pinot noir with good acidity. Neither is overwhelmed by its 14.5 percent alcohol.",
