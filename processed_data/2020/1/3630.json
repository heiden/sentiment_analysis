  "lead_paragraph": "Hello, Five Weeknight Dishes readers! I’m honored that Emily asked me to show up for her in this space. (She’s on leave for the next few months.) I take the responsibility of choosing weeknight-friendly recipes seriously. Years of food writing, and cooking for my own family after work, have taught me a lot of brilliant shortcuts. I also know how to spot the pitfalls: ingredients that need two stages of cooking, vegetables that take ages to peel, any spice you can’t pick up on the way home. I’ll be back next Friday, but, in the meantime, try these recipes and email me with your cooking hopes and dreams at dearjulia@nytimes.com.",
