  "lead_paragraph": "When the Nigerian-born fashion designer Duro Olowu found himself with time to spare between meetings one winter evening in London two years ago, he decided to take a walk down the Pimlico Road. Nestled between the residential districts of Chelsea and Belgravia, the charmingly old-fashioned street, lined with Victorian-era galleries and storefronts, is home to esteemed English interior design firms such as Colefax & Fowler, Rose Uniacke and Robert Kime. Along the way, Olowu, who splits his time between London and New York, was stopped in his tracks by an opulent window display at Soane Britain, the 23-year-old furniture, lighting and fabric maker that is particularly renowned for reviving disappearing artisanal techniques such as rattan.",
