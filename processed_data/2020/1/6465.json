  "lead_paragraph": "Good morning. Our J. Kenji López-Alt gave us a fantastic new recipe this week for moo shu mushrooms (above), based on the pork version his parents were introduced to by the chef Joyce Chen, who died in 1994. It’s accompanied by instructions on how to make Mandarin pancakes for wrapping the moo shu, but no one’s going to object on a Wednesday if you don’t do that. As Kenji advises, you can always serve the dish as the strip-mall Chinese restaurants do, with warm flour tortillas. Either way, you’ll eat very well.",
