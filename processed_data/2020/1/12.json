  "lead_paragraph": "Where do shining images take us? Arthur Sze’s 10th book of poems, “Sight Lines,” was selected as the National Book Award winner for poetry in 2019. Unusual verbs (spore, tumors) ignite his lines. A moment of visual precision, then a rippling out of thought-waves, breath. The reader, both rooted and released by the ending, feels the shimmer of refreshment in a moment’s gaze and possibilities: how any precise focus and pause affects us in its immediacy, then widens — and holds. Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye",
