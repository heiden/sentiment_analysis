  "lead_paragraph": "LINCOLN RHYME: HUNT FOR THE BONE COLLECTOR 8 p.m. on NBC. Human bones are strewn about New York in “The Bone Collector,” Jeffery Deaver’s 1997 novel about Lincoln Rhyme, a forensics expert who solves cases without leaving his apartment. He works with a younger detective who does the ground work in tracing a serial killer. The book was adapted into a 1999 feature with Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie, who had only the roughly two-hour running time of the film to crack the case. This new TV series adaptation should give its stars more wiggle room. It casts Russell Hornsby as Rhyme, who is left unable to walk after an injury on the job. So he works remotely, electronically communicating with a young officer (played by Arielle Kebbel), who pursues the case’s mysteries with Rhyme in her ear.",
