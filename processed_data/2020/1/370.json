Also dead, also translated: the Croatian novelist Dasa Drndic (1946-2018), whose work began getting its due in English toward the end of her life; her latest to arrive on these shores is “Doppelgänger.” Then we have a couple of posthumous collections: stories by Larry Brown (1951-2004) and essays by Brian Doyle (1956-2017), all of them pulsing with life.",
