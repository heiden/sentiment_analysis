  "lead_paragraph": "There are moments in the Chinese director Jia Zhangke’s “I Wish I Knew” when you feel agreeably unmoored. Beguiling images flicker across the screen and an unidentified woman (Zhao Tao, Jia’s wife and usual star) snaps open a hand fan. Later, she wanders through enigmatic, rubbly landscapes like an Antonioni heroine. Her presence is unexplained, though she seems to serve as a visual anchor or talisman for the director, who has a way of gently destabilizing your ideas about documentary, narrative conventions and even his own work.",
