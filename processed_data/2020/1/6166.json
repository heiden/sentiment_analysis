  "lead_paragraph": "Bistro is a rather modest description for a grand installation that includes a warmly outfitted bar area with 30 seats; a cooler, plant-filled conservatory-style dining room with zinc-topped tables and plush seating; another, brighter dining room up a few steps; and an airy private dining room beyond. It’s owned by Michael Stillman, who now runs Quality Branded. Designed by AvroKO, the space housed Sirio Maccioni’s Osteria del Circo but has expanded to seat 180. The chef, Antonio Mora, worked at the Ryland Inn, Daniel, for Keith McNally, and at the Brooklyn restaurants owned by Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli. His menu hews pretty closely to what you would consider bistro fare, though sometimes with a twist, like an Alsatian tarte flambée squared off like Detroit-style pizza. Expect French onion soup, escargots, steak frites, Dover sole meunière finished tableside, a pork porterhouse, tuna tartine and profiteroles.",
