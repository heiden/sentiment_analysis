  "lead_paragraph": "In 1938, the Philippine president, Manuel L. Quezon, rescued more than 1,200 German Jews from Nazi ghettos and gave them refuge. It’s a remarkable slice of history that seems made for a political thriller: While hatching his rescue plans, Quezon endured internecine conflicts, a relapse of tuberculosis and the final years of American colonial rule in his country. Unfortunately, in Matthew Rosen’s fictionalized take, “Quezon’s Game,” this story of intrigue turns stiff and sentimental.",
