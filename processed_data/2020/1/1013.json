  "lead_paragraph": "A Dutch Dutch oven is not a joke. BK, a cookware company in Wateringen, the Netherlands, has been making the pots for 150 years. Dutch oven is a term used for a lidded casserole, usually metal, that was first developed in England in the 17th century and so named because the process of molding the metal, originally brass, came from Holland. This BK line of enameled steel ovens, available in several sizes and colors, conducts heat well, and can be used to sear ingredients and then maintain them at a slow simmer, whether on the stovetop or in the oven. It’s excellent for winter braises, and the enameled interior is easy to clean. The company has also introduced a roomy skillet made of carbon steel, the must-have stovetop material preferred by chefs.",
