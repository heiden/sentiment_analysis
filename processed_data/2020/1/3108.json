  "lead_paragraph": "In the last 50 years, the N.F.L. has evolved from primitive roots that celebrated running plays known as “3 yards and a cloud of dust” to a contemporary aerial circus in which passing the football is the priority. Quarterbacks have become the rock stars of this modern football universe, and rare is a running back now valued with an early selection in the college draft (less than 5 percent of recent top-20 picks).",
