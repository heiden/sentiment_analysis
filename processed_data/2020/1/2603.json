As a reporter for a small-town Iowa radio station, I have the best seat in the house for the caucuses. I’ve seen all the candidates who have come to Iowa, most multiple times, interviewed nearly all of them, some more than once, and attended countless events. The largest, the Polk County Steak Fry in September, had over 12,000 attendees. The smallest was, um, about 10 people about a week or two ago (sorry, Marianne Williamson!).",
