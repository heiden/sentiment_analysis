  "lead_paragraph": "SEVEN WORLDS, ONE PLANET 9 p.m. on AMC, BBC America, IFC and Sundance TV. This new nature documentary series is narrated by none other than the veteran broadcaster and natural historian Sir David Attenborough. Each of the seven episodes spotlights how life developed on a different continent, as well as the factors threatening its biodiversity. This premiere focuses on Australia and its native animals, such as the eastern grey kangaroo and the Tasmanian devil. (The episode was filmed before bush fires started ravaging large swaths of the country but includes information on how to support relief efforts.) There is certainly no shortage of nature documentaries out there — some scenes in “Seven Worlds” have already been featured in the Netflix series “Our Planet.” Even so, in his review for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that “‘Seven Worlds’ is full of the usual beauty and spectacle.” ",
