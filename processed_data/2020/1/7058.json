  "lead_paragraph": "“I am a man of honor,” Tommaso Buscetta insists. It’s a familiar enough assertion for a man in his profession — he describes himself as a “simple soldier” in the Sicilian Cosa Nostra — and one that Mafia-movie fans have heard many times before. The context this time is a little different, though, since Buscetta (who goes by the nickname Masino) invokes his honor to justify his betrayal of the organization he had loyally served for his whole adult life. No omerta for him.",
