  "lead_paragraph": "No kindness goes unpunished in “John Henry,” a thug-life thriller so frequently preposterous that it almost resembles a parody. Like “John Wick,” its action is juiced by the killing of a dog; unlike that movie, its titular character (played by the likable Terry Crews) is stoically disinclined to vengeance. A gentle giant with shoulders like an ox, he’s so determined to escape his gangbanging past that when he finally lumbers into action, his weapon of choice is a sledgehammer, not a gun. And his first victim is a car windshield.",
