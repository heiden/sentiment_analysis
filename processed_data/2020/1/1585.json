When our second child graduated, the godfathers were going through a messy breakup and failed to acknowledge his graduation in any way. We’ve never mentioned this to the godfathers. Our second child is now about to earn his master’s degree. He recently told us he feels sad that his godfathers remembered his brother’s graduation, but not his. Should we remind the godfathers to acknowledge our younger son’s upcoming graduation and what they gave our older child? Trust me, it’s not about the money. We are still close with both men.",
