  "abstract": "She also wrote about the death of her son at 27, for which she blamed herself because she had been an alcoholic when she was pregnant with him.",
  "lead_paragraph": "Edith Kunhardt Davis had an idyllic childhood, growing up on a big, if run-down, estate in rural New Jersey. Her mother, Dorothy Kunhardt, a famous author of children’s books, wrote — just for Edith — “Pat the Bunny,” a 1940 novelty that had movable parts and invited young readers to touch and feel the textures on its pages. It remains one of the best-selling children’s books of all time.",
