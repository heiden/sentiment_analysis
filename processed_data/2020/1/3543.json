It’s safe to say that Mr. Barocas is a thinker of Big Thoughts, which also jibes with his becoming a familiar and popular Big Sunday byline — this is his sixth consecutive Sunday. Today’s puzzle has a slight mutation, coincidentally, and is a little bit Bigger — it’s a column wider than normal, 22 X 21, to better fit a Really Big Theme.",
