  "lead_paragraph": "When a designer is creating a clothing collection, jewelry is, more often than not, the final flourish. Not exactly an afterthought, but rarely the main event. For Schiaparelli’s spring 2020 haute couture show, which was held earlier today, the house’s 34-year-old Texas-born artistic director, Daniel Roseberry, turned this idea on its head. “This season I found myself designing entire looks around a piece of jewelry, and it’s become a whole language of the collection,” he said, a week before the Paris show, as he surveyed the trays of glittering ornaments that covered the long white wooden desk in his atelier. He pointed out his favorite piece: a choker made from faux pearls and brass casts of teeth — each one embellished with diamond cavities — that resembled an Edwardian ruffled collar in shape. “It’s our demented version of the iconic pearl necklace,” he said with a grin, “To me, this is like, ‘straight to the museum.’”",
