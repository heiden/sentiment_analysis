  "lead_paragraph": "THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA (2019) Stream on HBO platforms. The threat is veiled (in the literal sense) in “The Curse of La Llorona,” a horror movie about a killer spirit who takes the form of a weeping woman in a wedding dress. The movie casts Linda Cardellini as Anna, a widow with two children, a job in social services and a problem audiences can probably extrapolate from the film’s title: She’s cursed. Or, rather, she picks up a curse that comes in the form of La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman who starts terrorizing the family. (The character is based on a figure from Mexican folklore.) “More efficient than ambitious, ‘La Llorona’ is basically a maternal showdown with shock cuts and billowing curtains,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The director Michael Chaves, making the most of his silkily mobile, at times predatory camera (he likes to shift the point of view mid-prowl) delivers the horror classics nicely.” One of the movie’s producers is James Wan, known for the “Saw” and “Conjuring” movies. Fans of either of those series should be well served here.",
