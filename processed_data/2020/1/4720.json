  "lead_paragraph": "“What a Soldier Killed in Niger Left Behind” is a four-minute film that touches on themes of love, loss, the power of memory — and the objects that evoke them. It profiles Jenna, whose boyfriend, a U.S. Special Forces soldier, was killed in an ambush in Niger. The film powerfully and poetically tells of their love and their imagined future through the fragments he left behind — a voice message, a letter, a dog tag, a hat, a receipt.",
