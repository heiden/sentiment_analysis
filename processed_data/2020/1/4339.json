  "headline": "17 Years After SARS, Beijing Silences Critics Over Deadly Outbreak",
  "abstract": "Beijing has responded faster to the new threat than it did with SARS, but it still silences and punishes those who veer from the official line, with potentially damaging consequences.",
  "lead_paragraph": "The SARS disaster was supposed to drag China into a new era of openness and responsibility. The deadly disease rippled across the world 17 years ago, abetted by a Chinese government that covered up its spread. As the scope of it became clear, Chinaâ€™s journalists, intellectuals and other critics helped shame Beijing into opening up about the problem.",
