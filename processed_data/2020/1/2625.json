  "lead_paragraph": "Connoisseurs and top chefs know Ora King salmon; it’s farm-raised in New Zealand, high quality and approved by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. The company’s vermilion smoked version, cured over New Zealand’s manuka wood, has a haunting flavor that finishes with a touch of sweetness. Now, in addition to being available by the pound at some smoked fish purveyors, it’s sold nationwide, in full skinless sides of about two pounds presliced.",
