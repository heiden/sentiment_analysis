  "lead_paragraph": "CHEER Stream on Netflix. In the series “Last Chance U,” the director Greg Whiteley captured junior-college football on and off the field, mixing sports documentary wins and defeats with personal portraits of players. In this new series, Whiteley turns his attention to cheerleading. “Cheer” focuses on the competitive squad at Navarro College in Corsicana, Tex. The season builds toward a big competition — but, as with “Last Chance U,” its heart is set less on the question of whether the team will win or lose and more on the players, whose personal lives and emotions rush to the surface as they chase athletic perfection. “The way that we prepare, you keep going until you get it right,” the team’s coach, Monica Aldama, says in the first episode. “And then you keep going until you can’t get it wrong.”",
