But the odd one out also happened to be the surprise winner, Sam Mendes’s World War I thriller “1917,” which is only just beginning its theatrical run. And while prominent Netflix nominees like “The Irishman,” “The Two Popes” and “Dolemite is My Name” got blanked, most of the other winners on the film side are either on Netflix or available on other streaming services now, with Bong Joon Ho’s foreign-language champ “Parasite” coming next week.",
