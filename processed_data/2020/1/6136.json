  "lead_paragraph": "MIRACLE WORKERS: DARK AGES 10:30 p.m. on TBS. This strange comedy starring Daniel Radcliffe and Steve Buscemi is back for a new season, though the only elements that remain the same are the cast. This installment is an anthology, and it poses a contrast to the original “Miracle Workers” series, which was set in heaven with Radcliffe as an angel and Buscemi as God. Now, Radcliffe is Prince Chauncley, the simple-minded son of great tyrant who, as Chauncley points out, could probably benefit from anger-management therapy. The rest of the cast members return as medieval villagers who are trying to navigate life in a time of great ignorance, where, as the one of the characters is taught in school, “The Earth is flat, the devil is real, and that is everything that we know.”",
